# Public-Transport-Crowd-Management
A solution to manage crowd at public transport during Covid-19 pandemic

## Issue:
Since lockdown at most places is started to ease, people have started to move out and travel. Some people are dependent on Pubilc transports. But Public transports are crowded most of times. This can be a serious issue in covid-19 pandemic as people are supposed to maintain safe distance from each other. "Public Transport Crowd Management" helps to solve this problem

## Solution: 
This app provides the realtime data of seats availability in the public transport such as bus. Anyone willing to travel, will also get to see the sanitization status for the Bus and the health status of the Bus operator/s. This app also provides bus operators an interface to check whether any bus stop needs to be skipped as the area around that bus stop is marked as RED zone by government.

## How it works: 
1. **Provides Buses availble on a route** - App will list the buses available on the route/destination provided by an user.
2. **Provides Bus information** - Bus information such as live tracking, realtime seats availability, sanitization status of the bus, health status of the bus operator will be provided to the user as per bus selection.
3. **Manages bus stops under hotspot** - It will provide an interface to bus operators where they can identify whether any bus stop needs to be skipped on their route, as the bus stop is marked as RED zone by the government.
4. **Live tracking** - Bus operator can start/stop rides, and update the passenger counts, which will be used to further calculate and shown to anyone looking to take that bus.
5. **Sanitization and Workers' health** - Staff manager will have an interface where he/she can update the bus operators' daily health statuses and the sanitization status of the respective buses.
